        <p>
          Smile Up Charitable Foundation is a youth, volunteer-powered charity committed to getting young people
          involved in volunteerism and community service so they can discover their purpose and develop in many life
          skills, including leadership, empathy, and compassion. We are also committed to supporting other charities and
          organizations who focus on benefiting the lives of children through advocacy, awareness and action.
